# Running CodeIgniter 4 Application Locally

This guide explains how to run an existing **CodeIgniter 4** application on your local environment.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have **PHP** (version 7.4 or higher) installed on your system.

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

If you don't have the project, clone it from the GitHub repository:

```bash
https://github.com/rrtutors/AdvanceAlarmaManager.git
```

### 2. Run the Local Server

Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder, then run the following command to start the local server

```bash
php spark serve
```

This command will run the application on http://localhost:8080 by default.

### 3. Access the Application

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to view the CodeIgniter 4 application running locally.
